    "If we took symmetry into account then we could reduce the search space of possible actions that the learning agent has to look over. If however the opponent doesn't take symmetry into account then we shouldn't either because it's possible that the opponent has some certain preferences, and doesn't consider symmetric positions to be the same. So unless we are certain of our opponent's preference we should treat symmetric positions as different ones.\n",

    "A greedy player would learn to play worse than a nongreedy player because it won't explore the entire state space. For example an issue that could arise is that, the greedy player never explores certain moves which could potentially lead to victory or a better state.\n",
